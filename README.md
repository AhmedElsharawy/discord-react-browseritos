# discord-react-browseritos

A [chatbox](https://browseritos.mfelobes.ca) connected to a Discord server.
The project uses React, Discordjs and Nodejs.


## Instructions
To be able to use it on your own server, create a bot with the necessary permissions and add it to the server. 
Place your tokens in a .env file in the backend as follows:
```
TOKEN_ID=
CLIENT_ID=
CHANNEL_ID=
SSL_CERT_PATH=/home/yourPathHere.cer
SSL_KEY_PATH=/home/yourPathHere.key
GUILD_ID=
```

Install node dependencies by using `npm install` for both the backend and the frontend.

Run the backend using `node main.js`
Run the frontend using `npm start`
